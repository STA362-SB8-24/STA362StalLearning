    "text": "Instructor\nInstructor Dr.Â Tyler George\n Â  Cornell College, West 311\n Â   tgeorge@cornellcollege.edu \n\n\n\nClass Meetings\nApril 15th - May 8th\n Â  9am-11am & 1pm-2pm\n Â  West 201\n Â  Course Calendar\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\n Â  MWThF 3:05pm-4:05pm and by appt.\n Â  West 311\n Â  https://calendar.app.google/3AF98Uc9VdLwRdp39\n\n\n\nI am available far beyond these times listed. Please email me and we can set up a time to chat about class material or whatever you prefer! I will generally announce changes to office hours in class but I still suggest checking the Course Calendar to verify availability.\n\nYou Are A Priority\nMy goal this block is to help you learn the material. I want to first and foremost recognize that you are an individual and thus are unique and may learn uniquely. Additionally, your health and wellbeing are priority one. Learning cannot happen effectively if you donâ€™t meet your other personal needs. That all being said, I have structured the class in a way that I, from experience teaching and learning myself, think will be most beneficial for the majority of students. I promise you that I will do my best to create an inclusive and engaging learning environment. I ask that you keep an open line of communication between us for when you may need help and/or flexibility. You and your learning are why I am here.\n\n\nCourse Description\nThis course will introduce students to relatively new and powerful statistical techniques used to analyze data. The course will begin with a review of linear regression and an introduction to computer-based variable and model selection methods. Other topics will include classification methods, resampling methods for model-building, non-linear models, and tree-based methods. The computer software program R will be used throughout.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nAt the end of this course I would like you conceptually understand, be able to use apply, and interpret the results of\n\nThe variance/bias trade-off\nMeasuring quality of fits\nLinear model selection and regularization\nClassification including K nearest neighbors\nCross validation\nDimension reduction\nTree based methods\nUnsupervised learning\n\n\n\nPrerequisite\nTo be successful in this class, you should have completed STA 201, STA 202, and DSC 223.\n\n\nOpen Access Books â€“ Free!\nAll of materials for this class are free.",
